Jason: What are you telling Benny? Hey. Dummy. You missed this, this, and this? 
Sunny: Well, look, I I I think the the opportunity here is when Zoom took off, you know, you know, during the pandemic and at the start, it was really low friction.
Sunny: What's happened is as it's, you know, kinda gone enterprise, it it has lost some of that low friction stuff. 
Sunny: And now there was reasons for it.
Sunny: People were showing up in random zooms and all that. 
Sunny: So I'd say Go back to low friction, Minnie. Keep the cost super low. 
Sunny: I really like this idea of shortening the meetings, and so take take you're you're already kinda doing that.
Sunny: And so and then integrating with the other tools. 
Sunny: I think that's the the the biggest biggest, you know, feature here is integrating into other you know, workflows that we have.
Jason: It can connect the API to if this then matters Zapier and you've got 
Vinny: Yeah. We did Zapier very soon as well. 
Jason: Tons of tons of interaction.
Vinny: By the way, it's free. So, like, we're not even charging for it right now. 
Vinny: It's free because, you know, we want the models to learn and train 
Vinny: so the more conversations we have, the better we're getting at at at doing this. So it's, you know 
Jason: The good news for building services like this, I remember there was a Sequoia company, that made video conferencing as a service.
Jason: And I think all like AWS and Google, they all provide some sort of Video relay as a service now. 
Vinny: Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep.
Jason: Which one do you which ones have you tried or which one do you use? 
Jason: Any thoughts on the back end here and how effective that is for you. 
Vinny: I haven't been using those. Yeah. 
Jason: So did you you didn't have to write the video back end, though. Right? 
Vinny: No. No. No. No. we we use Agora. So I think we we use Agora on back end. 
Vinny: but we, you know, we, like, There there are a number of companies doing it, 
Vinny: and the Gore has been doing it for quite a while. And they're a public company and we've been working with, 
Vinny: you know, we we kind of used them, I guess, when Clubhouse is blowing up, and they were using Goran. We said, 
Vinny: okay. Well, we should try as well because they got some crazy amount of scale.
Vinny: And by the way, clubhouse went the same VC route as well. 
Vinny: They went to the VC's first. both the community and then it just blew up. And we we we started using Agora, 
Vinny: and the product has improved dramatically over the past 2 years.
Vinny: I mean, We, you know Of course. Product. 
Jason: Yeah. Of course. 
Vinny: Yeah. Yeah. 
Vinny: And the the the founder came from Webex, and the other founder, co founders,

Vinny: So, you know, these guys understand their business and we're very, like, we're we're very happy to you know, use their platform.
Vinny: And it's going well. I mean, like, through the quality we so when we're running this stream at 6:40 by 360, we can jack it up to whatever. Right? 
Vinny: So Yep. It's pretty, it's pretty easy for us to go up. And because while it's free right now, this is live in production, by the way. 
Vinny: So it's just free.
Vinny: So we're running low risk because why should we pay you know, the high risk, you know, 
Vinny: we're not charging people. 
Vinny: We're still in product development phase. 
Vinny: But as the product improves and we get I think we're gonna we can go up to 4 k.
Vinny: So, you know, and so we that could be a an upgrade package. Right? 
Vinny: So you pay for Wakeroom. The AI is built in. You want 4 k. You pay a little bit more. 
Vinny: You want, integrations into certain, you know, into Salesforce as a a fee for that.
Vinny: So there's You could 
Jason: also have a, a third tab here, which is transcript. 
Jason: And you can annotate the transcript. So you could have another one, just the, you know, 
Jason: running transcript And you could annotate it.Highlights. At the end of the meeting, 
Vinny: at the end of the meeting, you're gonna get a a a meeting minutes of the entire meeting. 
Vinny: So it it get emailed to you and then you can forward it around or you can send the people in the company.
Vinny: So we do it when you're ready. 
Jason: Even here, when you have an insight or a catch up or an action item, tells you the time stamp of it. And so that is super helpful. 
Jason: If you wanted to jump to the time stamp, you could. Yeah. And

Washington: sometimes what what I am talking to other people English. I frequently I forget some words that's necessary in the conversation.
Washington: And this is when I it's specific, it's is more difficult for me when I speak. Because I don't know if if maybe I I have to to to help many words in my vocabulary -- Mhmm. -- to turn this way more --

Saverio: have any You have to remember book, yes. Standard 1 is a family to our organization. And for I'm gonna say I'm gonna say page 
Saverio: on the same page of Washington because I think the grammar is not so difficult and what I find most useful is also watching news 
Saverio: but also read this small book is cambridge with the level of the level for your, it's a small story and it's very symbol for adding some vocabulary.
Saverio: And I think also the most difficult to 1 is Maybe you understand and you know 5000 word on the vocabulary, but when you have to speak 
Saverio: to choose the right 1, to pick the right 1 in the right moment and in the time is most difficult things 
Saverio: because maybe we're a little anxious maybe and so the most difficult 1 is speaking 
Saverio: speaking with the wild world and to try to express what you really think.
Mantho: That is true. Did you understand Washington? 
Washington: Yes. Yes. Can you type the title of this book for me in the chat? 
Saverio: Oh, okay.
